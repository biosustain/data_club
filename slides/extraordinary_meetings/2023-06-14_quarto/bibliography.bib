  abstract = {Kinetic models are key to understanding and predicting the dynamic behaviour of metabolic systems. Traditional models require kinetic parameters which are not always available and are often estimated in vitro. Ensemble models overcome this challenge by sampling thermodynamically feasible models around a measured reference point. However, it is unclear if the convenient distributions used to generate the ensemble produce a natural distribution of model parameters and hence if the model predictions are reasonable. In this paper, we produced a detailed kinetic model for the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli. The model consists of 82 reactions (including 13 reactions with allosteric regulation) and 79 metabolites. To sample the model, we used metabolomic and fluxomic data from a single steady-state time point for E. coli K-12 MG1655 growing on glucose minimal M9 medium (average sampling time for 1000 models: 11.21~{$\pm~$}0.14~min). Afterwards, in order to examine whether our sampled models are biologically sound, we calculated Km, Vmax and kcat for the reactions and compared them to previously published values. Finally, we used metabolic control analysis to identify enzymes with high control over the fluxes in the central carbon metabolism. Our analyses demonstrate that our platform samples thermodynamically feasible kinetic models, which are in agreement with previously published experimental results and can be used to investigate metabolic control patterns within cells. This renders it a valuable tool for the study of cellular metabolism and the design of metabolic pathways.},
